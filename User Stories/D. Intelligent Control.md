# Intelligent Controll

## Night Mode
- As a Cardriver I want a green light in the night, so I do not have to wait unnessesarily.
- As a Trafficliht I want to detect a single car, so I can give a green light to it.

## Adjusted times depending on traffic
- As a Trafficlight I want to scan the traffic, so I can adjust the signalling time. 
- As a Trafficlight I want to set up a row, so the cars get a green light in the order they arrived.

## Traffic counter
- As a Trafficlight I want to count the cars, so I know where to give the next green light.

## Communication with other lights
- As a Trafficlight I want to tell the others when to change color, so I can avoid accidents.
